/* Project 2: Beat That

How many hours did you spend on this assignment?: 15 hours (at least 4-5 nights)

What part of the assignment did you spend the most time on?: 
- Initially, the part that took the most time was deciding on the logic to use for multiple players, and using "nested arrays" (or arrays within an array).
- After this part was completed/coded, I had a lot of trouble deciding on how to get the results for tied players (for example, more than a single player who got the same high score)

How comfortable did you feel with this assignment? (1-5): About 2, with 5 being most comfortable

Is there anything in this code that you feel pleased about?: 
I was glad that I learnt how to Google and find online resources for the code. For example, I am happy that I managed to use new syntax like .splice

What's one aspect of your code you would like specific, elaborate feedback on?:
- Similar to the previous code, I found difficulty in deciding what is the proper way to get around coding -- i.e.: deciding on the logic to implement the code. Would appreciate advice on this! And how do seasoned / more experienced programmers decide on a logic that works and is easy to implement.
- I also am finding it difficult to refactor my code to make there more helper functions. I am afraid if I do remove parts of the code, the "nested arrays" part of it would not be able to work.
